## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Applications Not Showing in Admin Panel

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Look for `‚úÖ Loaded X [type] requests:` messages

   - Check collections: `artistRequests`, `advertisingApplications`, `affiliateRequests`
   - Verify documents exist with correct structure

3. **Check Firestore Rules**
   - Ensure admin users have read access to all collections
   - Verify security rules allow querying with `orderBy`

4. **Common Issues**
   - **No Index Error**: Create composite index for `orderBy('submittedAt', 'desc')`
   - **Permission Denied**: Check Firestore security rules
   - **Empty Results**: Verify documents were actually created during submission

### Submission Errors

1. **Check Form Validation**
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Check console for validation error messages

2. **Check Network Tab**
   - Look for failed Firestore API calls
   - Check for CORS or authentication errors

3. **Check Console Logs**
